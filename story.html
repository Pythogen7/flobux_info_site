         <h2 class="info-header">Where does Flobux's story begin?</h2>
        <p class="info-body">As the world increasingly adopts digital wallets, I recognized a need for a centralized platform to track and manage my finances. Existing solutions were either overly complex or over simplified and often unintuitive, inspiring me to develop my own solution. A very simple version of what would become Flobux was born.</br></br>I discovered many of my friends were struggling with financial organization, and I began brainstorming what it might look like to bring Flobux into a fully developed software for everyone to use.</br></br>Initially intended for my personal use, Flobux quickly evolved into a mission-driven initiative upon recognizing the widespread need for a more accessible and user-friendly budgeting tool.</br></br>Flobux is not aimed for profit. Any payments made towards additional links are directed towards supporting other users who utilize the free version of Flobux.</p>
      

        <h2 class="info-header">Consider Contributing or Donating</h2>

Alternatively, if Flobux has proven beneficial to you, donations made to me personally would be greatly appreciated and serve as an encouragement that Flobux is fulfilling its mission.</p>
